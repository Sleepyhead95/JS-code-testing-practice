# JS Code Test

This project is a part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer course I am currently taking. Here, I was tasked to write tester code in JavaScript to test the JS code provided. The framework for testing is Mocha, and we run it through Node.js in the terminal. 

## Skills learned
- Using Mocha
- Writing test code with 'describe' and 'it' blocks
- Using Node.js to run tests
- Assert methods
